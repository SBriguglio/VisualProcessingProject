# Visual Processing Project
### Author: Spencer Briguglio
### Description:
This project is a simple visual processing program designed to demonstrate the use of epipolar geometry in computer vision. The program creates a fundamental matrix from at least 10
manualy chosen points in each picture, then uses these matrices to draw epipolar lines in the images when the user clicks a pixel in the image. The program is also able to match pixels
in these epipolar lines using ZNCC method.
### Objectives:
Become familiar with Qt5, OpenCV, C++ and addressing common problems in computer vision.
### Outcome:
I've become very familiar with Qt5, OpenCV and C++ and OOP. This was definitely an exciting, challenging project to work on. I specifically chose to use C++ and not Python 
in order to improve my own skills in a very ubiquitous and powerful language. I am actually very interested in GUI design and Qt5 in addition to computer vision, which is not 
what I was expecting at all. A very well-rounded learning experience which I aim to continue adding to and improving. Definily looking forward to using both Qt5 and OpenCV again with C++.
### Issues:
Definitely a TON of refactoring to do. I would like to start from the beginning and better think out my pixelchooser class. I would like to implement some form of error handling in addition
to providing much, much, much better documentation and comments within the code. The pixel matching ZNCC algorithm could be improved along with the GUI in general so that any size
image can be used and not only 800x600 px images.
